I'll start by planning the migration and collecting a few key details so the Flask structure and behavior match your expectations. 

Created 10 todos

I'm going to quickly scan your current site pages, styles, scripts, and the reference Flask template in Context so I can ask precise preliminary questions and outline an accurate migration path.

Thanks—I'll set this up as a proper Flask app that mirrors your current site and the format shown in the Context templates. Before I scaffold and convert your pages, I have a few quick decisions to confirm.

## What I reviewed so far
- Current site lives under site with pages: index.html, about.html, resume.html, projects.html, contact.html
- Assets: styles.css, nav.js, `site/images/*`
- Root styles.css and scripts.js are empty (so I’ll ignore those)
- You asked to “reference the context folder and format similarly”: your Context example uses `templates/` + `static/` with `url_for`, which I’ll follow
- Resume.md exists at the repo root—you asked me to reference it for the resume page
- agent_notes.md has a template; I’ll update it after the migration

## Key questions (please confirm)
1. Routes and URLs
   - OK to switch links to clean Flask routes (`/`, `/about`, `/resume`, `/projects`, `/contact`) and update nav accordingly? I’ll add redirects from `*.html` to the route if you want backward-compatible links.

2. Resume rendering from Markdown
   - Do you want the resume rendered from Resume.md on the fly using Python-Markdown (adds a dependency), or should I keep the current HTML resume content?
   - If Markdown: do you want me to strip the first “Automatic Zoom / 1” lines (likely copy artifacts) or keep the file as-is?

3. Contact form behavior
   - Should I keep it front-end only, or wire up a simple Flask POST handler that:
     - just shows a success message (no storage),
     - or logs to a CSV file server-side (no email),
     - or sends an email via a provider (would require credentials and additional setup)?
   - Default if no preference: simple POST handler with a success flash, no storage.

4. Assets and structure
   - I’ll move `site/images/*` to `static/images/`, styles.css to `static/css/style.css`, and nav.js to nav.js. OK?
   - I’ll preserve your “bubble”/responsive styles and nav JS exactly.

5. Project layout and cleanup
   - I’ll create app.py at the repo root, `templates/` for pages, and `static/` for css/js/images.
   - Should I leave the old site folder in place as an archive, or remove it after migration?

6. Requirements and Python version
   - I’ll add requirements.txt with `Flask` and `Markdown` (if used). Any Python version constraints I should note (e.g., 3.10+)?

7. README and run instructions
   - OK to add a root `README.md` with run steps (`flask --app app.py run`), or do you want it integrated into the existing README.md?

## Planned deliverables (once you confirm)
- app.py with routes: `/`, `/about`, `/resume`, `/projects`, `/contact`
- templates: `base.html` (header/nav/footer), index.html, about.html, resume.html, projects.html, contact.html
- static: `css/style.css`, nav.js, `images/*` moved over
- requirements.txt (Flask [+ Markdown if chosen])
- Updated agent_notes.md documenting changes/assumptions
- Optional: redirects from `/*.html` to route equivalents

Progress update:
- I scanned your current pages and the Context Flask examples and prepared a migration plan. Next step after your answers: scaffold the Flask structure, port the pages into Jinja templates, wire routes, and verify locally.

Once you confirm the above, I’ll implement everything in one pass and share a quick run/verify summary.

rj-atwal1: yes, please do exactly that

GitHub Copilot: I'll start implementing the Flask structure, templates, routes, and static assets, then copy your images into the Flask static folder and update notes; this will fully migrate the site to Flask with Markdown resume rendering and a simple contact POST handler.

Progress: I created the Flask app with routes and templates, ported styles and scripts, set up Markdown resume rendering, added redirects for legacy HTML paths, and verified all core routes return 200 locally in a venv. Next, I’ll hand you concise run instructions and optional cleanups.
Nice—I've migrated your static site to a Flask app using the same structure as your Context examples and wired everything up, including Markdown rendering for your resume and a basic POST handler for the contact form.

## What I built
- app.py with routes:
  - /, /about, /projects, /contact (GET+POST), /resume
  - Legacy redirects: /index.html, /about.html, /projects.html, /contact.html, resume.html
  - /images/<filename> serves images directly from site/images (so no need to move them immediately)
  - 404 error handler with a friendly page
- Templates (Jinja2) in templates/:
  - base.html (header/nav/footer + bubbles slot + flash messages)
  - index.html, about.html, projects.html, contact.html, resume.html, 404.html
- Static assets under static/:
  - css/style.css (from site/css/styles.css, plus small flash message styles)
  - nav.js (from site/js/nav.js)
- Resume
  - Reads Resume.md, lightly cleans copy artifacts (“1” / “Automatic Zoom”), converts to HTML using Markdown package; safe-injected into resume.html
  - Falls back to <pre> if Markdown isn’t installed
- Docs and metadata
  - requirements.txt: Flask and Markdown
  - README.md: setup and run steps
  - Updated agent_notes.md with migration notes and next steps

Key files added/changed:
- app.py: Flask app with routes, resume render, contact POST, image serving
- templates/*: Jinja2 pages with url_for links and shared base
- style.css and static/js/nav.js: styles and nav behavior
- requirements.txt and README.md
- agent_notes.md updated with details

## How to run (macOS, zsh)
- I already validated locally in a virtual environment and got 200 OK for all core routes.

Optional commands you can run:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask --app app.py run --debug
```
Then open http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Notes and assumptions
- Routes use clean URLs and nav links use url_for
- Contact form: validates and flashes a success message; no storage/sending (as requested)
- Images are still in site/images and served via /images/<file>—this keeps your repo history intact without moving files yet
- The bubbles, layout, and responsive nav behavior are preserved

## Light housekeeping options (tell me if you want them)
- Move site/images/* into static/images and drop the /images route for an all-static asset path
- Add a 500.html and logging config
- Highlight active nav link
- Email send (via SMTP or provider) or CSV logging for contact form
- Clean up old top-level empty files (styles.css, scripts.js) and archive site/ if no longer needed

## Status update on your todo list
- Confirm structure and dependencies: completed
- Scaffold Flask app layout: completed
- Port static HTML to Jinja2: completed
- Implement Flask routes: completed
- Render Resume.md: completed
- Update styles and scripts: completed
- Requirements and run docs: completed
- Update agent_notes: completed
- Local verification: pending you to click through UI in the browser (I validated endpoints via curl)
- Clean up old files: pending your preference

Want me to move images under static/ and remove the special images route now, or keep it as-is?

Made changes.

rj-atwal1: yes

GitHub Copilot: I'm going to move your images into Flask's static folder, update templates to reference them via url_for('static', ...), remove the custom image route, and verify everything still works locally.

I'll copy your images from site/images to static/images using the terminal, then verify the images are served at the new paths and update the notes accordingly.

rj-atwal1: the resume page should be formatted to look like this. Right now, its just text jammed together. 

GitHub Copilot: I'll update the resume rendering to normalize your Markdown (convert section headers, bullets, and contact line), and enhance CSS for clean spacing similar to your screenshot; then I'll rerun the app and verify the resume page.

Ran terminal command: source .venv/bin/activate && curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://127.0.0.1:5000/resume

Ran terminal command: open http://127.0.0.1:5000/resume || true

Completed (9/10) *Local verification*

Thanks for the screenshot—I've updated the resume rendering and CSS so your page matches that clean, readable layout instead of a block of jammed text.

What I changed
- Resume Markdown normalization in app.py:
  - Promotes section titles (EDUCATION, EXPERIENCE, TECHNICAL SKILLS, ADDITIONAL) to headings
  - Converts • bullets to proper Markdown lists
  - Promotes your name to an H1 and keeps the contact line separate
  - Adds subheadings for lines like “Indiana University, Kelley School of Business – Bloomington, IN”
- Resume-specific CSS in static/css/style.css:
  - Clear spacing and hierarchy for h1–h4
  - Comfortable line-height and margins for p, ul, li
  - Width constraint for better readability (similar to your screenshot)

Result
- The resume page now uses headings, properly spaced paragraphs and bullet lists, and looks like a professionally formatted resume rather than raw text.

Optional quick check (if you want to reload locally)
- If your dev server is running, refresh http://127.0.0.1:5000/resume
- If you need to start it again:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
flask --app app.py run --debug
```

Notes
- I also moved images under static/images and updated templates to use url_for('static', filename='images/...'), and removed the old custom images route. This keeps everything in the standard Flask static path.
- Todo updates: Local verification is complete. Cleanup of old files is the only remaining item if you’d like me to archive/remove the legacy site/ HTML now.

Want me to:
- fine-tune heading sizes or spacing further to match the screenshot exactly?
- style the contact line (email/phone/LinkedIn) into a subtle top block?
- archive the old site/ folder and remove unused top-level empty files?

Made changes.


#Reflection# 
I asked to convert my static site to Flask, and the assistant started by scanning the codebase and clarifying key decisions (routes, resume rendering, assets, and contact form). That upfront alignment reduced rework. The migration landed in a clean Flask structure using templates and static folders, url_for links, legacy redirects, and a simple POST handler. I appreciated that my Resume.md was rendered and normalized, and the subsequent CSS pass made it readable and professional. Moving images into static/images and dropping a custom route simplified maintenance. The README and requirements made running locally straightforward.

Areas for improvement: intermediate logs in my dev notes were verbose, and some steps (like moving images) could potentially have been more formally checked before running them. Resume output on the first iteration was tight—a earlier pass of the CSS or the acceptance criteria for layouts would've avoided a round-trip. I'd like more consolidated status messages that are tighter and less fine-grained "apply patch" lines.

It's helpful to define the acceptance criteria soon (routes, redirects, resume formatting, asset locations) and start with some visual targets. Then I'll be archiving the old site, introducing simple tests, and thinking about deployments. Generally speaking, the cooperation proved effective and considerate of my topology.
