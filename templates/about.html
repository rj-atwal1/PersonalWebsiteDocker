        <p>My name is Rjvir Atwal, but most people call me "R.J.". I was born in Indianapolis, IN and have lived there ever since. I am a data-driven business strategist with a track record of translating complex operational issues into actionable insights.</p>
        <p>Key strengths include advanced data interpretation, consultative problem solving, proficiency with CRM platforms like Salesforce, and strong analytical skills for reviewing operational metrics. I thrive when partnering with cross-functional teams to turn ideas into measurable outcomes.</p>
        <p>I recently completed my Master's in Information Systems where I honed my technical foundation, including Python and SQL. My goal is to join a consulting team that values experimentation, continuous learning, and data-informed decisions.</p>
        <p>When I'm not crunching numbers, you can find me mentoring peers, exploring local coffee shops, or building new features for this site.</p>
