rj-atwal1: #codebase I'd like to create a data access layer for my website. Please model the website found in the assignment 6 file within the context folder of assignment 7. Model it like the one in the read and create files. 

Add or change the following to your Personal Website

Add a Data Access Layer file called DAL.py to hold.
DAL.py should include the statements - import sqlite and methods needed to interact with the database
Create a database called projects.db and create a single table in the database called projects. This table should have at least 3 columns (Title, Description, and ImageFileName).  You may add additional columns as needed.
Note: You will just drag and drop your images to your static\images folder.  You will not need to add the ability to upload or "submit" the actual image through the webform. We will add that later. (you can ask AI to help you with that feature if you want)
Convert your Projects page to pull your project information from the Projects table in your database.
Have each project displayed in an HTML table on your projects page. Each project should show a minimum of Title, Description and the actual image you associated with your project (should link to the image in your static/images folder).
Convert your Form page to allow a person to insert/add new projects into your Projects table. 
These projects should be viewable immediately by going back to your projects webpage
Add a delete page or the ability to remove projects from the database


All final files should be in the Assignment 7 folder.

Built out a database-backed clone of the Assignment 6 site with a dedicated data access layer so projects now live in SQLite and can be added or removed from the UI.

- DAL.py: creates projects.db, defines schema (Title, Description, ImageFileName plus links), seeds starter rows, and exposes helpers to list/add/delete projects.
- app.py: rewired routes to use the DAL, repurposed the old contact form as `/projects/new` for inserts, added a delete endpoint, and kept resume rendering plus legacy redirects.
- templates: refreshed pages (e.g., projects.html, `project_form.html`, base.html) to pull from the database, show an HTML table, and surface flash messages after inserts/deletes.
- static: carried over styling/JS and copied required images so seeded records resolve; requirements.txt lists Flask/Markdown.
- projects.db: initialized with three sample projects so the Projects page is populated immediately.

Next steps:
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt` (the editor warning about missing Flask will clear once installed).
2. `python3 app.py` and browse to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
3. Drop any new screenshots into images before submitting them via the Add Project form.

Made changes.

rj-atwal1: this is what my projects page looks like

GitHub Copilot: Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
The delete form on projects.html pointed to `url_for('delete_project', ...)`, but the route is actually named `delete_project_view`. I’ve updated the action to use the correct endpoint, so the Projects page will now render without the BuildError and deletions will post to the right route. Refresh the page (or restart the dev server if it’s running) and try deleting a project again.

Made changes.

rj-atwal1: After trying to upload the picture, it comes back with this on the projects page. It should be rendering the picture I reference.

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
The page was 404-ing the uploaded image, so I added a safeguard in DAL.py: every project now resolves its `image_filename` against images and falls back to `project1-placeholder.png` if the file isn’t there yet. Once you drop the actual screenshot (exact same filename you entered) into images, it’ll render automatically—no need to re-add the record. Restart or refresh the app to see the placeholder or your uploaded asset.

Made changes.

You’d entered Reggie.png into the form, so the database stored the whole path. When the template prepended `images/` again, the browser looked for `static/images/static/images/Reggie.png`, which doesn’t exist.

I’ve tightened the DAL so it now:

- strips any directory prefixes before saving (`Reggie.png` gets stored, no matter what you type),
- normalizes existing rows (so your current record already reads `Reggie.png`), and
- still falls back to a placeholder if the referenced file isn’t present.

Refresh the Projects page and the screenshot should render correctly, as long as Reggie.png is in place.

I collaborated with GitHub Copilot to create a database-backed Flask site for this Assignment. I began by requesting it to construct a data access layer (DAL.py) that kept project data in SQLite rather than hardcoding it. Copilot went through my Assignment 6 files and example DAL construction, and then it fleshed out the full structure—constructing the database, DAL functions, new Flask routes, and HTML pages with forms to create and remove projects.

In the first setup, it all worked fine, but I had a problem displaying uploaded images. My projects page continued to give me 404 pages with my images. After multiple iterations, I presented Copilot with screenshots and error messages. We identified the issue: I was submitting full file references (such as "static/images/Reggie.png") in the form, and this doubled up the path on rendering the template.

So, Copilot fixed this up by adjusting the DAL to remove directory prefixes from file names, tidy up the database entries, and add in a placeholder fallback. Then at last my project images appeared correctly on the portfolio page. Working through all that debugging really helped me understand how file paths in Flask apps work.
